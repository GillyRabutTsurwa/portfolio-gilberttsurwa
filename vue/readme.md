NOTES. For resizing photos, a good way is to make the width 2 - 2.5 larger than what it is on it's container or its display on the webpage if it doesnt have a container (for larger resolution screens), and the height will take care of itself. AFter that, use image compressor and it will make the site MUCH faster
